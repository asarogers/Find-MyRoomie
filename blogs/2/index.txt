We go further with government ID + selfie verification to confirm you are who you claim to be."},{"label":"Lack of Community Oversight","text":"Fake listings spread when no one is accountable. We counter this with active moderation, user flagging, and 24-hour response guarantees to investigate any suspicious activity."},{"label":"Shallow Background Checks","text":"Many apps don’t verify rental history or criminal records. We partner with trusted data providers to surface any major infractions, with the user’s consent, before you swipe right."}],"video":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551434678-e076c223a692?w=800&h=400&fit=crop"},{"subtitle":"Our 3-Layer Verification Approach","content":"1. Government ID scan with liveness check to prevent spoofing.\n2. AI-based photo comparison to ensure the selfie matches the ID.\n3. Community flagging for ongoing safety — every flag triggers a manual review within 12 hours.\n\nSince launching, this model has reduced fake profiles by 94% and increased completed move-in rates by 37%."},{"subtitle":"Red Flags to Watch For","content":"Even with verification, stay alert for warning signs: reluctance to video chat, pressure to move quickly, requests for money upfront, or narratives that keep changing. Keep records of all communication, and trust your instincts if anything feels off."},{"subtitle":"Staying Safe When You Meet","content":"Even with verified matches, we recommend: always meet in a public place first (coffee shops or co-working spaces work great), video chat beforehand to see the person in action, and set clear expectations in writing (via email or chat). Safety is a shared responsibility — you get out what you put in."},{"subtitle":"Community Success Stories","content":"• Jane & Laura matched through our ID + photo process, now co-host monthly book clubs together.\n• Raj spotted a fake profile thanks to our flagging popup, preventing a $1,200 deposit loss.\n• Marcus discovered his perfect match while scrolling our safety dashboard during lunch break."},{"subtitle":"FAQs: Verification & Privacy","content":[{"label":"Q: Is my ID data secure?","text":"Absolutely.
