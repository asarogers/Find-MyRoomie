When roommates bail unexpectedly, you're often left covering their portion or facing early termination fees. We show you amortized scenarios from NYC, LA, and Chicago."},{"label":"Credit Score Damage","text":"Missed rent payments can drop your credit score by 50–100 points, affecting future rental applications and loan rates for years. One case study saw a 120-point drop after two missed payments over three months."},{"label":"Security Deposit Loss","text":"Damage from irresponsible roommates often exceeds security deposits, leaving you with repair bills averaging $1,500–3,000.
